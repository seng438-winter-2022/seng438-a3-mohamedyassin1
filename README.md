For your convenience, we made two directories. One with our old test suite from Assignment 2, called "Old_Test_Suite", and one for our new test suite from Assignment 3, called "Revised_Test_Suite". In that one, much of the work was done on the "RangeAndDataUtilitiesAllOtherMethods.java" file, because we added white-box tests for every method in classes Range and Data Utilities to meet the coverage requirements.

Our lab report is in Assignment3-ReportTemplate.md
